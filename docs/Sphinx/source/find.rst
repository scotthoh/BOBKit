Finding C-alphas
================

This stage aims to locate a few very probably C-alpha positions in the electron-density map
using a search target based on a 4 Ã… sphere centred on the C-alpha atom. A six-dimensional
search in both position and orientation is performed and the highest scoring matches are 
assumed to be correct. These C-alpha positions will be used as seed points from which longer
chains will be grown. In subsequent cycles, the finding step is modified to preferentially
find C-alpha positions which are in regions where no model is present.

Classes which can be used for the finding routine:

* ``Ca_find`` for finding C-alphas in density
* ``Search_threaded`` for searching C-alpha groups
* ``SearchResult`` to store result scores.
* ``SSfind`` alternative to fffear for fast secondary structure finding
* ``Target_fn_refine_llk_map_target`` to refine C-alpha groups

Ca_find class
-------------
.. autosummary::

   bobkit.buccaneer.Ca_find

The constructor takes in two arguments. An int for number of seeds to find and a float for resolution limit.

``Ca_find.set_cpus()`` can be used to set the number of cpu threads to use in running the calculations.

There are two methods used in the finding routine.
The fastest method typically gives 2-3x speedup over the best method for a very similar model, but results might vary.

* ``Ca_find.TYPE.SECSTRUC`` for fastest method
* ``Ca_find.TYPE.LIKELIHOOD`` for best method

Either of the types can be passed as argument when calling the Ca_find instance.
The following arguments are required to run the finding routine:-

* a **clipper.MiniMol** object containing the working model or can be empty (during the first find), constructed from the spacegroup and unit cell of the input data
* a **buccaneer.KnownStructure** object containing information of known structure (can be empty if no known structure)
* a working map of type **clipper.XMap_float**
* a likelihood map target of type **buccaneer.LLK_map_target**
* fastest or best finding method ``Ca_find.TYPE.SECSTRUC`` or ``Ca_find.TYPE.LIKELIHOOD``
* modelindex: 0 to use all results, otherwise downweight 50% of results on the basis of position in ASU when filtering prior model (input work model)

The C-alpha finding stage starts by making a prior map from the given model and working map.
The prior map will be turned into a z-score followed by the filtering of the prior based on multi-model index given.
Search is performed and a long scores list is created from the maps of results. A pruned scores lists is then created omitting 
near-clashes. The best matches are refined before building a backbone model as the output.
The working model passed in to the finding method will be updated with C-alpha groups of the backbone model built.

.. doctest::

   >>> from bobkit.buccaneer import Ca_find
   >>> Ca_find.set_cpus(1)
   >>> cafind = Ca_find(500, 2.0)
   >>> cafind(mol_wrk, knownstruc, xwrk, llktgt, findtype, modelindex)
